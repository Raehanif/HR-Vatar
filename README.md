HR-Vatar
HR-Vatar is an AI-driven platform designed to automate the recruitment process by parsing resumes, conducting AI-powered interviews, and generating virtual avatars to represent candidates. Using advanced deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Whisper model, and Wave2Lip, HR-Vatar provides a comprehensive solution for HR departments to assess and interact with potential hires more efficiently.

# Features
1. Resume Parsing: 
Automatically parses and analyzes resumes to extract key information such as skills, experience, and qualifications.

2. AI Automated Interview: 
Conducts a simulated interview with the candidate using AI, assessing answers to pre-defined questions.

3. Video Analysis with Confidence Scoring:
Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze candidate video snippets, calculating confidence based on facial expressions, speech, and body language.

4. Whisper Model Integration:
Utilizes OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model to transcribe and understand audio in real-time during the interview process.

5. Wave2Lip for Lip Syncing:
Applies Wave2Lip technology to generate realistic lip-synced avatars of candidates during the interview process.

6. Combined Scoring System:
Scores candidates based on both their confidence (from video analysis) and correctness of answers, providing a holistic evaluation of their interview performance.
