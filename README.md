HR-Vatar
HR-Vatar is an AI-driven platform designed to automate the recruitment process by parsing resumes, conducting AI-powered interviews, and generating virtual avatars to represent candidates. Using advanced deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Whisper model, and Wave2Lip, HR-Vatar provides a comprehensive solution for HR departments to assess and interact with potential hires more efficiently.

Features
Resume Parsing: Automatically parses and analyzes resumes to extract key information such as skills, experience, and qualifications.
AI Automated Interview: Conducts a simulated interview with the candidate using AI, assessing answers to pre-defined questions.
Video Analysis with Confidence Scoring: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze candidate video snippets, calculating confidence based on facial expressions, speech, and body language.
Whisper Model Integration: Utilizes OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model to transcribe and understand audio in real-time during the interview process.
Wave2Lip for Lip Syncing: Applies Wave2Lip technology to generate realistic lip-synced avatars of candidates during the interview process.
Combined Scoring System: Scores candidates based on both their confidence (from video analysis) and correctness of answers, providing a holistic evaluation of their interview performance.
